GenTime accurately shows the page generation time in your WordPress admin bar.

== Description ==

= GenTime =

This plugin shows site administrators the time in seconds of how fast the page is generated in the WordPress top admin bar.

The generation time is calculated from when the server receives the page request to when the number is printed, which is close to the end of the request.

So, just PHP and the database impact this calculation. The time it takes to send the page from the server to your device is not included in this timer.

That's it, pretty simple!

== Installation ==

1. Install GenTime either via the WordPress.org plugin directory or upload the files to your server.
1. Either Network Activate this plugin or activate it on a single site.
1. That's it!

= Change the number of decimals =

Use this filter to change the number of decimals shown by the timer. The number defaults to 3, but this filter makes it 4.
`
add_filter( 'gentime_decimals', fn( $default = 3 ) => 4 );
`

([Where can I place filters?](https://tsf.fyi/docs/filters#where))

= Change the view capability requirement =

Add this to `wp-config.php` to change the user capability required to view the timer:
`
define( 'GENTIME_VIEW_CAPABILITY', 'manage_options' );
`
